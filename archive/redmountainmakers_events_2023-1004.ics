 s course is designed to introduce you to the 3d design process using Solid
 works CAD software\, a powerful 3D modeling tool used in a variety of indu
 stries. The course will cover the basics of Solidworks\, including the use
 r interface\, basic features\, and tools needed to create 3D models.\n

  be on learning the fundamentals Solidworks. You will learn how to navigat
 e the interface and tools\, create sketches\, and use basic features to cr
 eate 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric mo
 deling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.\n    </font>\

 all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the class. You w
 ill have the opportunity to see your design come to life and take it home 
 with you.\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Whether you're interested in creating
  prototypes\, product designs\, or just want to learn a new skill\, this c

 ” Fountain Pen!\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubuntu" 
 style="font-size: 18px\;">\n   The “Baron” fountain pen is trimmed wit
 h nibs\, clips and other elements made out of the highest quality silver p
 lating which gives each pen a distinguished look in addition to durability
 . Experience in turning would be helpful but is not required.\n  </font>\n
  </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 18px\;">\n  
  The fountain pen features an ultra-smooth threading removable cap that sc
 rews on to both the bottom and top of the pen. The Baron Fountain Pen not 
 only is a great looking pen\, but it is also light weight and one of the s
 moothest writing instruments available for everyday use and has a two-tone
  German made nib with an iridium tip. The artistic fittings are hand worke
 d and polished and the solid metal external components add to the pens exp
 ensive and hardy feel.\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubu
 ntu" style="font-size: 18px\;">\n   The Baron comes with both a siphon pum
 p and blue ink cartridge. This hand-crafted pen will make a unique gift to

 ” Fountain Pen!\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubuntu" 
 style="font-size: 18px\;">\n   The “Baron” fountain pen is trimmed wit
 h nibs\, clips and other elements made out of the highest quality silver p
 lating which gives each pen a distinguished look in addition to durability
 . Experience in turning would be helpful but is not required.\n  </font>\n
  </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 18px\;">\n  
  The fountain pen features an ultra-smooth threading removable cap that sc
 rews on to both the bottom and top of the pen. The Baron Fountain Pen not 
 only is a great looking pen\, but it is also light weight and one of the s
 moothest writing instruments available for everyday use and has a two-tone
  German made nib with an iridium tip. The artistic fittings are hand worke
 d and polished and the solid metal external components add to the pens exp
 ensive and hardy feel.\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubu
 ntu" style="font-size: 18px\;">\n   The Baron comes with both a siphon pum
 p and blue ink cartridge. This hand-crafted pen will make a unique gift to
  others or yourself and will be completely one-of-a-kind!\n  </font>\n </p
