   Learn to make an elegant hand-crafted “Baron” Fountain Pen!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   The “Baron” fountain pen is trimmed with nibs, clips and other elements made out of the highest quality silver plating which gives each pen a distinguished look in addition to durability. Experience in turning would be helpful but is not required.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   The fountain pen features an ultra-smooth threading removable cap that screws on to both the bottom and top of the pen. The Baron Fountain Pen not only is a great looking pen, but it is also light weight and one of the smoothest writing instruments available for everyday use and has a two-tone German made nib with an iridium tip. The artistic fittings are hand worked and polished and the solid metal external components add to the pens expensive and hardy feel.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   The Baron comes with both a siphon pump and blue ink cartridge. This hand-crafted pen will make a unique gift to others or yourself and will be completely one-of-a-kind!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   Each pen will be turned from beautiful exotic woods such as: King Cocobolo, Olivewood, Burmese Rosewood, Cherry Burl, Boxelder Burl, Red Mailee Burl, Bocote, Spalted Tamarind, Box Elder, etc. Students may choose silver plated or gold for the pen kit.
